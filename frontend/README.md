# The assignment is divided into 2 parts.

# 1. Frontend

# 2. Backend

# The backend of the website contains user models and routes. The routes connect to the APIs developed for storing user information during login.

# The frontend of the website contains the UI of the website and is connected to the backend. The website is divided into 5 pages.

# 1. Login page -- After the user is authenticated, the user is granted permission to enter the website from the initial login page.

# 2. Home page -- Home page contains a card with some text inside it. Below that an image gallery is created to showcase different products.

# 3. About page -- About page contains the basic info about the website. It also has a react map implemented which parses through the exixting users and showcases them as members.

# 4. Contact page -- Contact page of the website contains the contact info of the store and also includes a contact form allowing user to directly connect.

# 5. Job page -- The Job page of the website consists of current openings and includes a table consisting of the openings, domain and visa sponsorship information. The user can hover over different table rows with a colour changing hover effect.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
